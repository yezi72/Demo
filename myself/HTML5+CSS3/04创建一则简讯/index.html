                        There are people you love, your hobbies, triumphs, successes, and happiness. There is so much more than stress and fear. Stress does not make you better and fear does not make you happier. Many women suffer from chronic stress because they let it happen. They let stress control their minds and thus their lives. Fear is a complicated thing, but human beings – especially we women – have enough power to keep it at bay.

                            &quot;I am not telling you to dwell on the past. But embracing your past struggles that helped you become who you are now (surely, you are much stronger today than you were yesterday) is a powerful way to recognize your inner strength and become emotionally stronger than ever.&quot;

                        Want to say something? Do it. Want to disagree? Do it. Want to stay home instead of partying? Say no. Whether you are an introvert, extrovert, or ambivert, chances are you are guilty of hiding your emotions and keeping silence when you strive to speak up. Give yourself more freedom, even if it means simply screaming into pillows. I mean, who of you can actually do it?

                        Moving your body is crucial while exercising your emotions is a must. Put yourself in situations that will help you grow. That is a huge challenge for introverts, I know it from my own experience. I often find myself in situations that make me feel weird and uncomfortable, but I never run away. Instead, I stay, calming down my fears and constantly repeating myself that I can cope with any emotional risk. Emotional risks help nourish your emotional stamina, helping you become strong.
